## Plans for Future Development

The application will also allow users to search for games and view game details. The application will also allow users to view the top 10 games on the market and view the details of those games and add/delete to a wish list.

The application will also involve sending and receiving friend requests to other users. Users will be able to view their friends' collections and wish lists.
